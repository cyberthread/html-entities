# Challenge: HTML Entities
This assignment is to practice adding HTML entities and symbols into your HTML, as well as to practice using inline text semantics.

There are two references you might find particularly helpful with this challenge:
- [Typewolf's Typography Cheatsheet](https://www.typewolf.com/cheatsheet) to easily reference HTML entity codes and when to use those entities.
- [MDN's HTML Elements Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) to look up HTML tags that are used to markup inline text to define the meaning and purpose of individual letters, words or phrases in the content.

## Hints

- abbr (4 instances)
